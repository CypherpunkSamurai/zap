## Support

All Pull Requests are welcome.

If you are a non-coder or was inspired by this small project, I would be glad if you would :star2: this repository, and spread the word with your friends and foes :smile:



## Credits

This project has been possible with the help and support provided by the AppImage community. Thanks to the detailed responses I received from mentors at AppImage's freenode channel.

Many parts of this documentation have been adapted (~~plagiarized~~) from [The OhMyZsh Project](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), you may find the documentation structure is almost similar. And also the installation script.
